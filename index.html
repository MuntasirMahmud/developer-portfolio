                <h3>2017-2021</h3>
                <p>
                    Asta and Yuno were abandoned at the same church on the same day. Raised together as children, they
                    came to know of the "Wizard King"â€”a title given to the strongest mage in the kingdomâ€”and promised
                    that they would compete against each other for the position of the next Wizard King. However, as
                    they grew up, the stark difference between them became evident. While Yuno is able to wield magic
                    with amazing power and control, Asta cannot use magic at all and desperately tries to awaken his
                    powers by training physically.When they reach the age of 15, Yuno is bestowed a spectacular Grimoire
                    with a four-leaf clover, while Asta receives nothing. However, soon after, Yuno is attacked by a
                    person named Lebuty, whose main purpose is to obtain Yuno's Grimoire. Asta tries to fight Lebuty,
                    but he is outmatched. Though without hope and on the brink of defeat, he finds the strength to
                    continue when he hears Yuno's voice. Unleashing his inner emotions in a rage, Asta receives a
                    five-leaf clover Grimoire, a "Black Clover" giving him enough power to defeat Lebuty. A few days
                    later, the two friends head out into the world, both seeking the same goalâ€”to become the Wizard
                    King!</p>

                <h2>Naruto</h2>
                <h3>2002-2007</h3>
                <p>Moments prior to Naruto Uzumaki's birth, a huge demon known as the Kyuubi, the Nine-Tailed Fox,
                    attacked Konohagakure, the Hidden Leaf Village, and wreaked havoc. In order to put an end to the
                    Kyuubi's rampage, the leader of the village, the Fourth Hokage, sacrificed his life and sealed the
                    monstrous beast inside the newborn Naruto.Now, Naruto is a hyperactive and knuckle-headed ninja
                    still living in Konohagakure. Shunned because of the Kyuubi inside him, Naruto struggles to find his
                    place in the village, while his burning desire to become the Hokage of Konohagakure leads him not
                    only to some great new friends, but also some deadly foes.After that he goes on a journey with
                    Jaraiya Sensei for training to beat Akatsuki. </p>
